## What’s the best way to get started learning about computer security?
You would definitely need to be organized. Both with time (devote only so much to training, so much time for lab work and so much time towards reading). You would also need to be highly organized with the digital side. Book marking every website you come across on security is fine, but organize it, classify it and then save it. Don’t just go on a spree on collecting all the programs/apps, eBooks or white-papers if they will just be collecting digital dust in your computer. It is great to save them, but it is very easy to be overwhelmed and lose concentration/direction.
